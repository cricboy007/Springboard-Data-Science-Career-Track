# springboard
  With this 6 months workshop I will master the data science process, from statistics to data wrangling and storytelling by working on real projects. I will have the option to choose a specialization: like Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing, that aligns with my career goals. With the guidance of a personal mentor and career coaches, I will graduate with a industry ready portfolio in Sept'18.
