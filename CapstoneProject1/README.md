# Allstate Purchase Prediction Challenge

### 1) What is the problem you want to solve?
Using a customer’s shopping history, can you predict what policy they will end up choosing?


------------


### 2) Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?
As a customer shops an insurance policy, he/she will receive a number of quotes with different coverage options before purchasing a plan. This is represented in this challenge as a series of rows that include a customer ID, information about the customer, information about the quoted policy, and the cost. Your task is to predict the purchased coverage options using a limited subset of the total interaction history. If the eventual purchase can be predicted sooner in the shopping window, the quoting process is shortened and the issuer is less likely to lose the customer's business.

### 3) What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
Data is freely available for non commercial use at See **https://www.kaggle.com/c/allstate-purchase-prediction-challenge/data**

------------


### 4) In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later)
1. **General process to follow**:
	2. Analysis of data: pull data into dataframe using pandas, do describe, come up with a strategy to fill up or ignore missing values
	3. Analysis of structured data
6. **Data Modeling using clusters:**
10. **Plot box plot, charts, identify words that indicate some issue, look for co-linear and covariance fields.  **

### 5) What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

1. Working code in python jupyter notebook on github.
2. Paper explaining EDA, modeling and accuracy of solution
3. Youtube presentation using slides explaining EDA, modeling and accuracy of solution
