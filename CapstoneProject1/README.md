# Two Sigma Connect: Rental Listing Inquiries

### 1) What is the problem you want to solve?
How much interest will a new rental listing on RentHop receive?
you will predict how popular an apartment rental listing is based on the listing content like text description, photos, number of bedrooms, price, etc. The data comes from renthop.com, an apartment listing website. These apartments are located in New York City.

The target variable, interest_level, is defined by the number of inquiries a listing has in the duration that the listing was live on the site.

### 2) Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldn’t have otherwise?
Finding the perfect place to call your new home should be more than browsing through endless listings. RentHop makes apartment search smarter by using data to sort rental listings by quality. But while looking for the perfect apartment is difficult enough, structuring and making sense of all available real estate data programmatically is even harder. You will predict the number of inquiries a new listing receives based on the listing’s creation date and other features. Doing so will help RentHop better handle fraud control, identify potential listing quality issues, and allow owners and agents to better understand renters’ needs and preferences.

### 4) In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later)
1. **General process to follow**:
	2. Analysis of data: pull data into dataframe using pandas, do describe, come up with a strategy to fill up or ignore missing values
	3. Analysis of structured data
6. **Data Modeling using clusters:**
10. Plot box plot, charts, identify words that indicate some issue, look for co-linear and covariance fields.  **
